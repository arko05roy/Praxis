# So You Think This Won't Work

**"You can't let people trade with money they don't own!"**

Oh really? Let me introduce you to:
- Every hedge fund ever
- Prop trading firms
- Your uncle who "definitely knows a guy"

The difference? They use lawyers and NDAs. We use smart contracts and math.

## The Elevator Pitch (30 Seconds or Less)

PRAXIS lets skilled traders use LP capital **without ever touching it**. The money stays in a vault. The trader gets *permission* to execute strategies. Smart contracts enforce the rules. Profits are split. Everyone goes home happy.

```
Traditional Lending: "Here's $100k, pinky promise you'll return it"
PRAXIS:             "Here's permission to use $100k that we're holding hostage"
```

## Why Should I Keep Reading?

Because you're one of two people:

**Type A: The Skeptic**
> "This is just lending with extra steps. It'll get exploited. Someone will find a way to rug."

Cool. [Section 8: Safety](8-safety.md) has six layers of "try me" waiting for you.

**Type B: The Curious**
> "Wait, this actually makes sense. How do I use it?"

Welcome aboard. Start with [Section 1: WTF is an Execution Right?](1-wtf-is-execution-right.md)

## The Core Insight (For the Impatient)

You don't need to *own* money to *use* money.

Your company credit card lets you spend $10k/month. You don't own that $10k. You have **execution rights** over it. The company sets limits. You stay within them. Everyone's happy.

PRAXIS does this for DeFi trading. Except instead of HR sending a passive-aggressive email when you overspend, a smart contract just reverts your transaction.

More efficient. Less drama.
