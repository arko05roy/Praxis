ConfirmedBlockHeightExists
Assertion whether a block with the specified blockNumber is confirmed with additional data to compute the block production rate within a given time window.

Supported chains
Network Type	Supported Chains
Mainnet	BTC (Bitcoin), DOGE (Dogecoin), XRP (XRP Ledger)
Testnet	testBTC (Bitcoin Testnet v3), testDOGE, testXRP
Request
Field	Solidity Type	Description
blockNumber	uint64	The block number to confirm.
queryWindow	uint64	The time period (in seconds) to calculate the block production rate.
Response
Field	Solidity Type	Description
blockTimestamp	uint64	The timestamp of the block at blockNumber.
numberOfConfirmations	uint64	The required number of confirmations for the block to be considered confirmed (chain-specific).
lowestQueryWindowBlockNumber	uint64	The block number of the latest block with a timestamp strictly less than blockTimestamp - queryWindow.
lowestQueryWindowBlockTimestamp	uint64	The timestamp of the block at lowestQueryWindowBlockNumber.
Verification process
The function checks if the block with blockNumber is confirmed by at least the required numberOfConfirmations for the specified chain.
If the block does not meet this requirement, the request is rejected.
A block at the tip of the chain has exactly 1 confirmation.
The lowestQueryWindowBlock` is identified, and its block number and timestamp are extracted.
The required confirmations are defined based on chain-specific finality.
The returned timestamp is:
mediantime for Bitcoin and Dogecoin.
close_time for XRPL.
Lowest used timestamp
For the lowestUsedTimestamp parameter, the value of lowestQueryWindowBlockTimestamp is used.

Finality
Blockchains have varying confirmation depths to consider blocks as final.

Chain	chainId	Confirmations required	Confirmation time
Bitcoin	0	6	≈60 mins
Dogecoin	2	60	≈60 mins
XRPL	3	3	≈12 seconds
