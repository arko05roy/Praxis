AddressValidity
Assertion whether a given string represents a valid address on an external blockchain.

Supported chains
Network Type	Supported Chains
Mainnet	BTC (Bitcoin), DOGE (Dogecoin), XRP (XRP Ledger)
Testnet	testBTC (Bitcoin Testnet v3), testDOGE, testXRP
Request
Field	Solidity Type	Description
addressStr	string	The address string to verify.
Response
Field	Solidity Type	Description
isValid	bool	Indicates whether the provided address is valid.
standardAddress	string	The standardized form of the validated address if isValid; otherwise, an empty string.
standardAddressHash	bytes32	The keccak256 hash of the standardAddress if isValid; otherwise, a zero bytes32 string.
Verification process
The address is verified against the validity criteria specific to the chain identified by sourceId. If the address meets all criteria:

isValid is set to true.
The standardAddress and its standardAddressHash are computed.
If the address is invalid:

isValid is set to false.
The standardAddress is empty and standardAddressHash is zero value.
Lowest used timestamp
For the lowestUsedTimestamp parameter, the value 0xffffffffffffffff (equivalent to 
2
64
−
1
2 
64
 −1) in hexadecimal) is used as the default.

Address validity criteria
Bitcoin
An address on Bitcoin is derived from the locking script (pkscript). Only standard locking scripts get assigned an address. There are two formats of the Bitcoin addresses, Base58 and Bech32(m). The format is determined based on the type of locking script.

Base58
Bitcoin's Base58 format uses the following encoding dictionary:

123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz

Address Structure
Decoded addresses have the format:

<leadingByte><hash><checksum>

Components
leadingByte:
On mainnet:
00 for Pay-to-PubKey (p2pk) and Pay-to-PubKey-Hash (p2pkh)
05 for Pay-to-Script-Hash (p2sh)
On testnet:
6f for p2pk and p2pkh
c4 for p2sh
hash: Represents either the public key, hash of the public key, or hash of a script.
checksum: The first four bytes of the double SHA-256 hash of <leadingByte><hash>.
Validation Criteria
Address contains only characters from the Base58 dictionary.
Decoded hexadecimal form is exactly 25 bytes long (address length varies between 26 to 34 characters).
Starts with a valid leadingByte.
The checksum is valid and matches the first four bytes of the double SHA-256 hash.

Bech32(m)
Bech32 is a newer address format using the character set:

qpzry9x8gf2tvdw0s3jn54khce6mua7l

Address Structure
A Bech32 address has the following components:

Human-Readable Part (HRP):
bc for mainnet
tb for testnet
Separator: Always 1
Data Part:
The first character indicates the witness version (0-16).
The last six characters form a checksum.
The checksum differs based on the witness version:

Bech32 for witness version 0 (BIP-0173)
Bech32m for witness versions 1 to 16 (BIP-0350)
Validation Criteria
Address contains only characters from the Bech32 dictionary.
All non-numeric characters must be either entirely uppercase or lowercase.
Starts with a valid HRP followed by the separator (1).
Length is between 14 to 74 characters, with the length modulo 8 being 0, 3, or 5.
For witness version 0, length must be 42 or 62 characters.
Checksum is validated based on the witness version.
Addresses with witness versions 2 and above are unsupported and invalid.

Dogecoin (Base58)
Dogecoin uses a Base58 dictionary, identical to Bitcoin's:

123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz

Address Structure
Decoded addresses have the format:

<leadingByte><hash><checksum>

Components
leadingByte:
On mainnet:
1e for p2pk and p2pkh
16 for p2sh
On testnet:
6f for p2pk and p2pkh
71 for p2sh
hash: Represents either the public key, hash of the public key, or script hash.
checksum: First four bytes of the double SHA-256 hash of <leadingByte><hash>.
Validation Criteria
Address contains only characters from the Base58 dictionary.
Length is 26 to 34 characters. Decoded hex form is 25 bytes.
Valid leading byte:
Mainnet: Starts with D, A, or 9.
Testnet: Starts with n, m, or 2.
The checksum is validated.
XRPL (Base58)
The XRP Ledger uses a custom Base58 dictionary:

rpshnaf39wBUDNEGHJKLM4PQRST7VWXYZ2bcdeCg65jkm8oFqi1tuvAxyz

Address Structure
Decoded to hexadecimal:

<leadingByte><publicKeyHash><checksum>

Components
leadingByte:
On mainnet: 00 (addresses start with r).
publicKeyHash: A 20-byte hash of the public key.
checksum: The first four bytes of the double SHA-256 hash of <leadingByte><publicKeyHash>.
Validation Criteria
Address contains only characters from the XRPL Base58 dictionary.
Length is 25 to 35 characters. Decoded hex form is 25 bytes.
Address starts with r.
The checksum is valid.
